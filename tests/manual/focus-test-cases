Different kind of focus handling cases.

No tabs:
- external link                         => external link loaded
- launch browser from the app grid      => home page loaded
- launch a favorite from the app grid   => favorite loaded
- search from web                       => overlay open, focused, and vkb open
- cover new tab action                  => overlay open, focused, and vkb open
- tap cover area (not new tab action)   => overlay open, focused, and vkb open

Browser has tabs:
- external link                         => external link loaded
- launch browser from the app grid      => previous tab loaded
- launch a favorite from the app grid   => favorite loaded
- search from web                       => overlay open, focused, and vkb open
- cover new tab action                  => overlay open, focused, and vkb open
- tap cover area (not new tab action)   => chrome visible, no vkb

A web page kicks in a sub page like m.aamulehti.fi:
- Enter m.aamulehti.fi as a url
- Push browser to switcher
- Wait that loading completes (for a while), new tab action disappears when sub page pushed to the pagestack
==> Cover showing the web page
==> Tapping the cover area brings up the browser and sub page visible

The package sailfish-browser-tests contains following manual test case:
- xdg-open /opt/tests/sailfish-browser/manual/testwebprompts.html
1) Focus the text input containing a text: "Focus and press enter to trigger prompt"
2) Press enter to trigger prompt :)
   ==> "A word or two" silica text field is roughly at center of the screen and focused
   ==> Virtual keyboard is open
3) Pop the prompts from the page stack
4) Repeat steps from 1) to 3)
